I. File List
------------
- sh_header.h  
  - Header file. Contains libraries & prototypes.  
- sh_main.c  
  - Contains main function. It finds the enviroment PATH and calls other functions until user enters "exit".  
- sh_path.c  
  - Contains our get_path function that splits the PATH into a 2D array.
- sh_input.c  
  - Contains functions that handle the user input and convert it into a 2D array.  
- sh_ string_concat.c  
  - Contains functions that concatenate strings.  
- sh_get_path.c  
  - Contains function that checks the PATH for the specified executuble.  
- sh_execve.c
  - Contains function that creates a new process and executes the command.  
- sh_double_pointers.c
  - Contains funtion that frees/prints double pointers. 
- sh_helper_functions.c 
  - Contains functions that help us run the code.

II. Design
----------
The program is designed to mimic the abilities of a simple shell. It is capable of handling commands with arguments. For example "ls -l". It can also handle the path as an argument, for example 
"/bin/ls". It works also in nonteractive mode, for example "echo "/bin/ls" | ./myshell". Below are some examples:

Example:  
**$ ls**  
main.c	path.c	execute.c	stringConcat.c  

**$ /bin/ls**  
main.c	path.c	execute.c	stringConcat.c  

**$ ls | ./myshell**  
main.c	path.c	execute.c	stringConcat.c  

**$ pwd**  
/home/vagrant/shell/simple_shell  

**/bin/pwd**  
/home/vagrant/shell/simple_shell
